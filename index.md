# Realms of Ostiver

## The Federation of Pirates
![|450](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PIeNLABGipxxhf7kH5qy7cmOf41D1xkQk2L4oNC6WDpHC1pJnSr4CI4Q5L0KKZMM-v1WF0iR_Xk4-iQgmvNTfOpXASpP9BqXV_kqlt4TcQ8LPk2zT5v3gWROIMFxWndyZ4RjTaYIqlfwlbY2etTGvKw)

The Federation of Pirates is a brand new colony that has only existed for the past 25 years or so. It was founded by a powerful group of pirates who took advantage of political unrest in the Bulark Tropics to establish a lawless, pirate utopia. The government here is a stratocracy, where the strongest and most adamant leaders command respect and power. The economy revolves around piracy and trade, with the country serving as a hub for illegal goods and black market items. 

The military is a strong aspect of the Federation of Pirates, with the navy made up of pirate ships and privateers carrying out missions on behalf of the government. The buildings and infrastructure in the Federation of Pirates have a distinct pirate/utilitarian aesthetic, with wooden and stone buildings adorned with skull and crossbones motifs, metal strewn across as patchwork, and buildings on stilts to prevent destruction from the fierce ways.. The social hierarchy is based on wealth and power, with the most successful pirates holding high positions in government. The legal system is based on the pirate code, with harsh punishments for those who violate it. 

## Uorarity
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PWBjdq4WE39UkiG4f5wwhj4opD66JJnBdUuVbaNEOew_oRIkzH3sxBiaqOLE__EvLgQHCJNS9Y1Snenuj3PPRXdeS6N8yrLCc3y8QFpLK8vDyHN9xPJsBUgTFDlEiSOUO4aekFmi7Cl5PZUrURbor7g)

Uorarity is a lawless land, with towns and cities loosely governed by gangs. There is no centralized government, and power is determined by money, strength, and drugs. The country is located near the Dreadlands, and its geographical features include the Ashen Plains, the Obsidian Ridge, the Magma Pits, the Poisoned River, and the Rift. 

The economy is based on the production and distribution of drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods, and the culture is shaped by the various subcultures of the gangs. Uorarity has a relationship with the Numerey Alliance, but neighboring countries view it with suspicion and fear due to its lawlessness. The proximity to the Dreadlands has influenced the country, with many gangs believed to have made deals with underworld creatures and nefarious mages.

## Celestni
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SDFWVtd3AjjLIKDP5ZkKTB1rGCU6jdxY0uQWolFuLLFB3oFd1BAPqHK85zIhDnNin-fvqGyKzn-1KOR-1GV9rqQwP5Bkzp5zYPNEnsWOQQ2Gq-n8c2HtulPn05s4STJcOlJUZhQMnA3DVX8YqW05xX0)

Celestni is a monarchy with a lower bracket council to handle local issues, and its society is divided into nobles, commoners, and slaves. The country's economy thrives on the rare metals found in the Dreadlands, which borders Celestni to the west. The land is rugged and inhospitable, but the eastern region is more fertile and gentle, allowing for agriculture and trade to flourish. 

  

Celestni has a long history dating back to ancient times, and its people value loyalty, integrity, honor, and faith. Despite the challenges posed by its surroundings, Celestni's people are resilient and resourceful, with a strong sense of community and devotion to their culture and traditions.

## Dunguen
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IfvRjk5xc0IiPRNOGMfbK_wMlS_x9mUj7340zt6NKuPCqizSd43LEt5DYYGOOLCzCZ6dTC2blhSf4z_DZTRxYB5DlQJiTVxnXNvqDabhBmFTr_lffWsv-rOkCiwxoOx1PG26kc3rtW9V1FxDmAGQC84)

Dunguen is an isocracy, where every citizen is on an equal political playing field, and decisions are made through public vote and discussion. The country is situated on the southern coast of the continent, with a more temperate climate and least influence from the Dreadlands. Magical materials is one of their most important industries, as the land has been found to be a hub for magical alchemical growth and rare magic metals, and there is a focus on sustainable practices and environmental stewardship. 

The culture values egalitarianism and community involvement, but this can sometimes lead to slower decision-making. Dunguen maintains friendly relations with its neighbors and is part of an alliance for mutual defense and economic cooperation, although they are inherently distrustful of Uorarity and by extension Celestni.

Duston is a small country in Ostiver, with a population of around 2,200. The country is a natural wonder, covered in lush and serene foliage, animals, and other natural wonders. It is the Focal Point for the Paragon of Nature – the Mother Paragon herself, and as such, it is a source of latent energy, making it a medium for magic. The main races that make up Duston are elves and humans, who usually get along due to their deep respect for nature. The government is a theocracy, and while nobility and privilege exist, the quality of life is still much better than most other places. 

Duston's economy relies on its exports of textiles and fruits/vegetables, and its nature attracts many travelers and vacationers to its friendly shores. The Coldmantles Spinners and IronLaws Naturalistics are two guilds in the country, focusing on textiles and farming/survivalism, respectively. The geography of Duston makes it a hotspot for tourism, with lovely forests and plains, The Ancient Heights mountain range, the Mariareey Gardens, and the Mother Tree itself. 

Duston's military is very small, relying on the Mother Paragon for protection. The country's infrastructure is basic, and the roads and walkways are simply worn dirt, while the outer wall of the capital is a large, basic stone wall. Crime is not a big issue in Duston, with low population and isolation making it not worth it for criminals.

# Races

## Humans

One of the newest races in Ostiver, humans were created as the balance between all races. Known to be creative, versatile, and full of ingenuity, they are truly the practitioners of everything but masters of none.  Don’t let that make you underestimate them, though, as they have earned their ranks as some of the greatest in many different skills/practices.

## Elves (new and ancient)

Throughout the centuries, elves have become masters of magical items and certain aspects of magic. Known for their classic pointed ears, the elves in Ostiver have actually deviated since their creation many millennia ago. The “Ancient Elves,” are elves that were born eight+ centuries ago. They were known for their immense, seemingly endless wells of potential in regards to magic. Ancient elf archmages were common, but that would come at a cost. That endless well stared back at them like a void, and many ancient elves are/have been driven mad with it.

New Elves on the other hand have more natural inclination to magic, but their well of magical potential isn’t endless like Ancient Elves are. 

Physically, the only real difference is that some of the Ancient Elves have a slightly more blue tint to their skin. But sometimes it's indistinguishable.

## Fultin

The Fultin are actually a collection of three subraces, each with very different physical attributes and characteristics.

One of the subraces has a very cheetah-like appearance. They are swift, agile, and are infamous for  their skills in thievery missions. In addition, their excellent eyesight makes them great archers

Another one is very lion-like. As lions are, they are famous for world renowned strength. Many of them are prized as fantastic mercenaries for their overwhelming intimidation and strength.

Lastly, the most magically inclined (although much less so than their Elf counterparts), the last subrace is lynx-like in appearance. They are a combination of the previous two, to much less degrees and a sprinkle of magic inclination filled in.

The Myrian are a race that are very small in stature, but hold a very big impact on the world. Being big  players in world trade and politics, the Myrian know their way with bartering and words and are renowned for their diplomatic abilities. 

Physically, they can be very off putting to some who have not seen them before. They stand around  3.5ft tall, and are usually shades of gray, purple, or pink. They have one eye in the center, and a beak like that of a toucan. They have wings, but are not very adept at using them

The Ashtekar are a very unique race in the sense of their perception of the world. While similar to humans in stature and figure, there are a few key differences.

For one, they don't have eyes… or so it seems. Where a typical humanoid race's eyes would be, are instead shapes of glass (unique per Ashtekar of course). The angles on the glass let them read info about the light around them and as such can see through the light that bounces around the world around them. 

In addition, they don’t have ears. Instead they sense vibrations and pressure differences around them.

They are typically human height, and are extremely wise, uniquely nimble, and magically fluent. They are very dark as most of their body is shades of either black or deep purple.

Being born to the frigid cold, their large bodies have been built to handle the intense  freezing that is experienced permanently in the north. Their appearance is similar to that of a bear. Some clans  of other races are known to have lived in the north for centuries, but none do it better than the Fruthians, and  those that do outside the Fruthians are a minority.

The Lylyn are a race that were known as “the love child of the gods.” With a body covered in what looks like a gold tinted marble, the Lylyn’s distinct features are wings made of seemingly light. Although it is a physical, biological material. Most of them are very religious to one of the Blessings, and those who swear fealty to other gods become corrupted, their eyes turning from a pure color to a red, black, or  green. 

Their origins were rooted in the combination of the Kresh and Human race, and possess many skills that each have.

Their distinct downside is that the Lylyn takes centuries to reach full maturity, and decades to uhhh... produce.

A mysterious race that keeps mostly to themselves, the Ushvar can be considered extremely off putting  and unfriendly to someone that has never seen one before.

Physically, the Ushvar have a very unique look to them. They have a long face, with six small eyes in a hexagonal shape on the top of their head. 

Four arms protrude from their shoulder area, and their “leg” is actually just one long and wide limb with many small “feet” on the bottom that seemingly levitate them around.

Rumors say that this race was cursed as of member of their race tried to access the Kyln to master necromantic magic
